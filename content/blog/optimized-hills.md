### Hill locations are still untapped, but need better technology
Hills have the best onshore wind potential to meet growind demand for wind power, but there are also challenges: often, there is no space for installation and transportation of large turbine parts is either expensive or simply impossible.

With demand for wind power growing and legacy wind power technology reaching the limits of deployment potential, the time is ripe for a new technology that will enable future growth.

WindNext modular wind turbines, designed for hill placement, are the solution.

## Showcase: Spain - Madrid region

Spain is a good example of a country with limited potential for wind energy expansion using legacy technology due to terrain configuration. We performed an in-depth analysis of the Madrid region to demonstrate this. Regions marked with black are areas with wind potential using legacy technology, while regions marked in red represent additional locations unlocked by WindNext technology.

### Additional wind potential of Spain - Madrid with WindNext: 2500 MW


##### For the whole of Spain, legacy technology enables 30.000 MW of wind farms. Using WindNext, this number jumps by **60.000 MW.**
##### For the whole of Europe, legacy onshore wind farm potential is estimated at 220.000 MW. Using WindNext, we can unlock an additional **300.000 MW.**
