### Bird safety around wind farms is a global problem

The problem of bird and bat fatalities due to wind turbines has been well documented. Often, it forms the basis for the local community opposition to installation of new wind turbine farms. The need for a wildlife safe solution is particularly prevalent in the areas of the world where there is a huge
wind power potential, but limited area to develop wind farms due to wildlife conservation concerns. There have been innovations designed to deflect bats
and birds to reduce risk, such as ultrasonic boom boxes, blades painted dark, radar detection of flocks that cause turbine shut downs, and similar.

The key cause of bird fatalities is the essential invisibility of the traditional turbine. The lack of shroud and the rotation of the turbine with the winds mean that there is no constant obstacle that the birds could get used to and navigate around.

### WindNext solution

WindNext turbines are fixed in place and have an obvious shroud. This constant obstacle enables simple detection by birds and bats, greatly reducing harm to wildlife.



The design was approved by the Birdlife society of Slovenia (DOPPS), which stated:

> “We believe that the WindNext modular turbine design lowers the risk of collisions with birds, as the frame represents a visual barrier enabling the larger birds to see the obstacles.”
