### Current technology

Modern wind turbines have over 8,000 parts and blades as long as 70 meters. The rise in turbine size also increases stress and load on the structure. All of this leads to the projected life span of 20 years. After that, the teardown is costly and a lot of the parts, like the blades, are challenging to recycle.

### WindNext approach

Due to their smaller size, WindNext modules are by definition less efficient. To make economic sense, this lower efficiency had to be addressed. Our designers worked hard to deliver a solution that makes up for lower efficiency by extending the lifetime of the module by up to 3x to 60 years.
