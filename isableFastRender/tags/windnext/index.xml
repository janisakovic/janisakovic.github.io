      <title>Zero infrasound</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;infrasound-and-its-effects-on-humans-and-animals&#34;&gt;Infrasound and its effects on humans and animals&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Infrasound is sound with very long wavelengths, a planar wave structure and outside the range of normal hearing for moderate sound pressure levels. The attenuation of infrasound is complex; it initially increases with distance from the source (becoming quieter), but it can decrease over still further distances so that it then gets louder. When it interacts with buildings, it can produce secondary structural vibrations that may be perceptible to the occupants. Infrasound from wind turbines is particularly annoying because the sound signature contains short, frequent episodes and it persists over extended periods, compared with other short-duration sources (such as trains). Most people can ‘tune out’ repeated sounds but in some people the central nervous system becomes sensitized and they suffer the symptoms of chronic noise stress such as anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and disrupted sleep (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670722006126&#34;&gt;source: Wind turbine infrasound: Phenomenology and effect on people, ScienceDirect&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>3x ROI - our pilot project in-depth</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2025/05/01/pilot-example/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;current-technology&#34;&gt;Current technology&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Modern wind turbines have over 8,000 parts and blades as long as 70 meters. The rise in turbine size also increases stress and load on the structure. All of this leads to the projected life span of 20 years. After that, the teardown is costly and a lot of the parts, like the blades, are challenging to recycle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;windnext-approach&#34;&gt;WindNext approach&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Due to their smaller size, WindNext modules are by definition less efficient. To make economic sense, this lower efficiency had to be addressed. Our designers worked hard to deliver a solution that makes up for lower efficiency by extending the lifetime of the module by up to 3x to 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
